Flex-Image-Cropping-Component
=============================

An image cropping component for Flex 3.  The [original website](http://blog.mediablur.com/2008/02/20/flex-image-cropping-component/) that hosted this and its source code disappeared into the ether, so I've saved a copy on GitHub for posterity. This component powers the image cropping functionality of ImageSizer.

Sample code to come soon!
